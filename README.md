# amazing-a32-os

Linux-based system for the Innovatech/TWM Amazing A32 phone: the stock Linux
kernel with a Rust userspace.

## Device profile

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| SoC | MediaTek MT6737M, Cortex-A53 cores running a 32-bit kernel |
| ABI / Rust target | `armeabi-v7a` / `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf` |
| RAM / eMMC | 891 MB usable / 7.1 GiB |
| Display | 480x854 |
| OS on the phone | Android 7.0, build `091318` (2018-09-13) |
| Kernel | Linux 3.18.35, no loadable modules, no devtmpfs |
| Boot state | Bootloader unlocked |
| Boot partition | `mmcblk0p7`, 16 MiB, offset `0x1d80000` |

## Firmware

The kernel comes from the stock OTA package, which is not stored in git:
`phone-tools/firmware/full_esky6737m_35_n-ota-110520.zip` (build `110520`,
2020-11-05). Its whole-file signature verifies against the OTA certificate
installed on the phone. It is newer than the build on the phone.

## Build and test

```sh
cargo test-host          # runs unit tests on the Windows host
scripts/build-image.sh   # builds target/a32-boot.img, does not touch the phone
```

No ARM GCC toolchain is needed: the build uses Rust's bundled LLD and musl.
`gzip` and `unzip` come from Git Bash.

## Behavior

- Run as PID 1: mounts `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys` and `/run`, creates device nodes,
  logs to the kernel log, starts a USB serial debug shell (VID `0e8d`, PID
  `2007`), then reaps child processes forever.
- Run as any other PID: prints a read-only device report and exits.

Both paths have run on the phone. The PID 1 path was tested with a RAM boot for
about 75 seconds; long-running stability has not been tested.

## Boot the image on the phone

The bootloader must be unlocked. This loads the image into RAM only, so a normal
reboot returns to Android:

```sh
fastboot boot target/a32-boot.img
```

About 20 seconds later the phone appears as a USB serial port (`0E8D:2007`,
`COM3` on the development PC). Open it with DTR enabled and type `help`. The
kernel logs each USB serial transfer, so `dmesg` output takes tens of seconds.

## Fastboot on the Windows development PC

- Fastboot mode only enumerates on a port of the AMD CPU USB controller
  (`VEN_1022&DEV_149C`). Ports on the chipset controller (`VEN_1022&DEV_43EE`)
  fail with "Device Descriptor Request Failed".
- The bootloader reports USB ID `0BB4:0C01` (product `ESKY6737M_35_N`), which is
  missing from `android_winusb.inf`. Install the Google USB Driver manually:
  Update driver, Browse my computer, Let me pick, Show All Devices, Have Disk,
  then choose Android Bootloader Interface.

## Known risks when booting the image

- The system does not start the stock battery services (`healthd`,
  `fuelgauged_static`). The kernel reports battery level and charging status,
  but long-term charging behavior is unverified.
- The kernel in the image is newer than the build on the phone.
